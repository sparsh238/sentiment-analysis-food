# Sentiment Analysis of Mess Food Reviews
This is a Django-powered website for gathering and analysing the sentiment of reviews of mess food of a college, using a Linear SVM text classifier.

The project is run simply like how every Django project is run; navigate to the project root directory in Command Prompt/ Terminal, and type python manage.py runserver.

Additionally, the python environment running the project should have sklearn and nltk installed to run the classifier model successfully.
